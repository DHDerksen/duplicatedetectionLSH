# Duplicate Detection with Locality-Sensitive Hashing
This code is used to perform duplicate detection with Locality-Sensitive Hashing, based on the work of Hartveld et al. (2018). A dataset containing data on 1624 TVs from four different webshops is used.

The structure of the code is as follows: first the data is loaded, then all the necessary methods are defined. After some general values are set, the code is called to run in a grid search in order to manually perform hyperparameter tuning.

The code is written in collaboration with Tommaso LÃ¼thy, and is an assignment of the Erasmus School of Economics.
